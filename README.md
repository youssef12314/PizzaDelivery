# Pizza Delivery Planner

## Description
The Pizza Route Planner is an interactive application designed to find the most optimal route for a pizza delivery service.
It uses Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest route between the pizza location and various addresses to ensure the most efficient delivery.
The web app allows the user to input their address, and it returns a detailed route plan that includes the distance (edges) between the delivery points (nodes).
